#If working on Envoy based deployments on own machine or AWS machine
In browser : use the right node_ip

#This loads the MediaWiki installer (config/index.php).

#Database configuration

During setup, provide database details. Use the MySQL service deployed:

Database host → mediawiki-mysql (the service name in Kubernetes)
Database name → mediawiki (from MYSQL_DATABASE)
Database user → root
Database password → rootpassword

#Create admin account

The setup wizard will ask to create an administrator username and password.
Save this, which will be used to login

#Get the LocalSettings.php file

At the end of setup, MediaWiki will generate a LocalSettings.php file.
Normally, it asks to download it.

In Kubernetes, we need to mount it into our MediaWiki container, otherwise our settings won’t persist.
#copy the file in running pod
kubectl cp LocalSettings.php <mediawiki-pod-name>:/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php

#
Log in with admin user.
Use the “Create” tab to make a new page, e.g. TestPage.
Add some text and save it.

#Verify
curl http://<node-ip>:30080/mediawiki/index.php?title=TestPage
